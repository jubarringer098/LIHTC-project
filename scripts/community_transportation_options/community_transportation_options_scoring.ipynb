    "# Audit of Community Transportation Options Score\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## I. Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Goal:** This document outlines the methodology used to audit and verify **Community Transportation Options** scores claimed by applicants under the **State of Georgia 2024-2025 Qualified Allocation Plan (QAP)**, Section XII.\n",
    "*   **Purpose:** The primary objective is to provide a systematic and data-driven approach to assess the validity of applicant claims regarding proximity to public transit, focusing on:\n",
    "    1.  The **accuracy of walking distance calculations** submitted by applicants compared to independently calculated network distances.\n",
    "    2.  The preliminary assessment of **transit hub qualification** for nearby stations identified via external data sources.\n",
    "*   **Methodology Summary:** The audit uses:\n",
    "    *   A comprehensive dataset of potential transit locations across Georgia, generated by querying the **Google Places API** (Phase 1).\n",
    "    *   Network-based walking distance calculations using **OpenStreetMap data via the `osmnx` library** (Phase 2) originating from the specific applicant site coordinates.\n",
    "    *   Systematic application of the QAP Section XII distance thresholds and point values.\n",
    "*   **Scope:** This audit focuses on verifying the distance-based points claimed under Sections XII.A (Transit-Oriented Development - Hubs) and XII.B (Access to Public Transportation - Stops).\n",
    "*   **Limitations:** While this process automates distance verification and flags *potential* hubs based on API data, it serves as a **preliminary audit**. Final determination requires **manual verification** of specific QAP criteria not directly captured by the automated tools, including:\n",
    "    *   Confirmation that a potential hub meets the QAP's 3+ distinct route definition.\n",
    "    *   Verification of operational requirements (e.g., 5+ days/week service, fixed route/schedule).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## II.Phase 2: QAP Community Transportation Scoring \n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Goal:**\n",
    "   To automatically calculate a preliminary QAP Community Transportation score for a given applicant site by finding the walking distance to nearby transit stops and potential hubs identified in Phase 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Inputs:**\n",
    "    *   `georgia_transit_locations_with_hub.csv` (Output from Phase 1 - list of stops/hubs with coordinates and hub flag).\n",
    "    *   Applicant Site Coordinates (Latitude, Longitude).\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Outputs:**\n",
    "    *   A printed console report showing:\n",
    "        *   Closest stop distance & potential Section B score.\n",
    "        *   Closest potential hub distance & potential Section A score.\n",
    "        *   Final preliminary score (Max of A or B).\n",
    "        *   Notes on required manual verifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Method:**\n",
    "    1.  Load Phase 1 transit stop/hub data.\n",
    "    2.  Filter stops within ~1 mile (straight-line) of the applicant site.\n",
    "    3.  For filtered stops, calculate *network walking distance* from the applicant site using `osmnx` and OpenStreetMap data.\n",
    "    4.  Identify the closest stop and closest potential hub based on calculated walking distances.\n",
    "    5.  Apply QAP distance thresholds and point values (Sections A & B) to determine the preliminary score.\n",
    "    6.  Format and print the results, including required verification notes.\n"
